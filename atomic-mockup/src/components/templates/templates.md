# Containers

This is where I feel we would be housing our report-sections on components of that complexity, I don't feel that our report-sections are complex enough to be a feature and should be housed in sub folders here.

### Containers Are Like Templates/Pages

Templates and Pages (pages are just instances of templates) also contain organisms, molecules, and atoms. The joining together of these smaller components makes up our user interfaces in our applications.
