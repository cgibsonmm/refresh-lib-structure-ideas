# Folder proposal MK-1

A lot of ideas here come from this medium article [thinking-about-react-atomically](https://medium.com/@wheeler.katia/thinking-about-react-atomically-608c865d2262), I feel that it makes a lot of sense for our use case because we are attempting to build a shared lib that also handles more complex features

## Thoughts

1. File/folder naming convention, only folders that have a direct decendent that renders a JSX.element, test, or render a JSX.element should be capitalized all others should be lower case
2.
